2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
full_name=input("Enter your full name:")
initial=""
for name in full_name.split():
  initial+=name[o].upper()

 else:
       print("The string is not a palindrome.")
