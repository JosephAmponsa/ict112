"""
1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.
"""
original_string = "Programming"
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)



"""
2.Create a Python program that takes a userâ€™s full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."
"""
def print_initials(full_name):
    names = full_name.split()
    initials = ".".join(name[0].upper() for name in names)
    print(f"{initials}.")


"""
3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.
"""
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    return s == s[::-1]


"""
4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
"""
def count_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return len(words)


"""
5.Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of "is" with "was" in the string "This is a string and it
is an example." Print the modified string.
"""
```
original_string = "This is a string and it is an example."
modified_string = original_string.replace("is", "was")
print(modified_string)
